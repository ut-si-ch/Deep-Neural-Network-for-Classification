# Deep Neural Network for Classification (Fashion MNIST Dataset)

## ðŸ§¾ Overview

This project builds and evaluates a **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** using **Keras** to classify images from the **Fashion MNIST** dataset. The DNN model learns to distinguish among various fashion items such as shirts, shoes, and bags based on pixel-level image data.

## ðŸ§  Business Understanding

Image classification is foundational for many real-world applications in:
- E-commerce (product tagging and recommendations)
- Healthcare (diagnostic imaging)
- Manufacturing (defect detection)

This project simulates how a deep learning pipeline can be applied to a structured visual dataset to automate classification tasks efficiently.
